This site collects notes [I](https://darribas.org) have been producing over
time, mostly in the form
of Twitter threads, but maybe I get excited about writing again and this takes
a different turn. I am not going to call it the [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)
word, because that might suggest it will be updated with certain regularity.
It might. It might not. I'm treating this as a drawer to mirror some of the stuff I
regularly gift the big tech companies with and that I would like to keep in a
more tangible/storeable/archiveable way. I hope you enjoy it!

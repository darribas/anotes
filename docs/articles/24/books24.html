Spotify just dropped Wrapped.
The lists of the best everything in 2024 start rolling on.
And I can’t help having a go at mine.<label for="GR" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="GR" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">You can see a slightly fancier version
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/5317416">here</a>. I’m
reluctant to pay much attention to it because a) it counts my two dropped
books as read and b) because… Goodreads. It’s 2024, your service is no
better than in 2014. Most frustratingly, it <em>could</em> be sooo much better. Oh
well, digression… </span>
One of the few practices I’ve kept over the years, even in the face of pretty
substantial life style changes (e.g., baby) is reading. So, here’s my list of
books from 2024.
Let’s get all due caveats out of the way first of all. It’s
technically not a “best of” but rather “all of”. I did not <em>love</em> all the
books in there, but I did read them. Unlike many smart people profess, I have a really hard time
giving up on a book I have started. This year though, I’m glad I stuck with all
of them. Also, technically, I did not <em>read</em> all of them either. A good chunk of
them I listened to while doing the dishes (more on this below). And, at the risk of stating the obvious, it’s
December 11th., the year has not ended. I’m currently on three books 
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144421737-what-if-we-get-it-right">one</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40859000-delta-v">two</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112976320-how-infrastructure-works?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=HAl0FKAfW5&amp;rank=1">three</a>)
that I might or not finnish before the year is out. All are very good.
Unless something radical changes, none would replace my picks this year.
So, on we go.</p>

<p>If by best we mean a book that makes you stay up way too late reading, and you
think about long after you’ve finished, the clear winner this year is <em>The
Deluge</em>. It’s hard to state in words how much I liked what is a 900p. book mostly
about climate change. Don’t be fooled though, this is not the type of
sci/cli-fi where characters and story are simple vehicles for the Big Ideas.
There are lots of those (Big Ideas), but there are also real characters.
People you come to love, despise, and find uncomfortably close to you. Since I
finished it, I’ve been looking for someone, anyone, who’s read it too and is
up for a coffee, because there are so many bits I’d like to discuss with
another human about this book. Unfortunately though, the search goes on…</p>

<p>The other book that surprised me in many and good ways was <em>Doppelganger</em>.
I’m the proud owner of a 1,999 paper copy of NoLogo, which I devoured as a
highschool student. After that, I figured there would be little in Naomi
Klein’s writing I wouldn’t agree with or would change my views, so did not
read more. How wrong I was. Admittedly, this is the most and least Klein book
I can think of. It is something only her could have written and only now,
after decades of craft. And is a really hard book to pull off. It’s about so
many things (her confusion with Naomi Wolf, conspiracy theories, right-wing
politics in the XXIst Century, doppelgangers in culture and art over history,
Jewish identity…) that it is hard to classify or even summarise. But it’s
well worth your time. Go read (listen to) it.</p>

<p>Honorary mentions. This has been a good year for reads. It’s also been a
terrible year in many personal aspects of my life. In the worst of it in May,
I picked up <em>Where there’s a will</em>, and I’m so glad I did. Chappell’s account
of what it really means to win a race so brutal like the Transcontinental is
everything I needed to read about human endurance, empathy, and
humbleness.
<em>Impossible people</em> was also a phenomenal (graphic) read. Wertz’s account of
her own alcoholism is so raw, hopeful, and just pure
funny.
And last but not least, <em>Devil in a blue dress</em>. My friend Al turned me on to
this, and I’m so glad he did. This is L.A. Confidential from the
African-American perspective. It’s a great detective story, it’s so well
written, and it’s an approach to race that, although written in the early 90s,
reads just as fresh in 2024.</p>

<p>A couple of thoughts to close. First, almost all
non-fiction I consumed this year was listened. I’d love to have the brightness
and mental capacity to spend 40 minutes every night getting lost in thorough
arguments. The truth is I don’t. Instead, I do have about that time every
night when I wash the dishes and clean the kitchen. One day, in an ideal
world, I’ll do all my reading, well, by reading. For what is worth, I do agree
with the snob argument that reading is a better way to engage with writing
than listening. It gives you more space to think and let the content change
you. It’s just that such option is not in the cards right
now.
Second, I have tried to read as much from women as from men now for a few
years, with varying degrees of success. This year I think I was fairly OK with
it. This year, it’s almost been a perfect split between fiction (men) and
non-fiction (women). I need more female fiction
recommendations!
And third, something I started this year is to systematically take notes and
write down impressions as I was reading. I started towards the autumn, so I’ll
reserve conclusions on that for the future (including whether the practice
sticks at all!).</p>

<p>So, that’s it, one more year. If you know me a bit, you know I like talking
books, and I’m <em>always</em> looking for more recommendations. So feel free to hit
me up with books that have made your 2024 a better tour around the sun!</p>

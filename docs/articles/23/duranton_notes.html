      <h1>Duranton's notes on Urban Economics</h1>
<p class="subtitle">July 11, 2023</p>

<p><label for="intro" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="intro" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">The original tweet that inspired this post is
<a href="https://twitter.com/gandhisahil/status/1678344609028505601">here</a> but, in
case the “bird” decides to change things up, the slide deck discussed is
available on this World Bank <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/7d8f5ff1f24147782e84f69c5647944b-0050022023/related/YUE-Keynote-Gilles-Duranton.pdf">URL</a> directly. </span></p>

<p>My usual doom scroll on the bird this morning took me to this slide deck by
Gilles Duranton, “New Frontiers in Urban Economics Research:
A personal view”. I wish more big names did this more often. The academic
system leaves little formal room for speculation, personal views, and
synthesis of the kind that does not fully fit on a journal article (though,
incidentally, I think this one would quite nicely!).</p>

<p>Anyhow, here’re my notes from the slides (I was not lucky to be in the
room…), most of them repdouced here as the <em>original text</em> with additional comments.<label for="disclaimer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disclaimer" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A couple of caveats, these are partial in the sense they are biased
and in the sense they are incomplete. They contain more my own thoughts as
contained in Duranton’s words, much more eloquent I could possibly do
anyway. </span></p>

<p>The talk is structured around two themes: recent improvements in urban
economics, and what I’d call “currently hot topics”. The former is then
subdivided into: modeling, data, methods. I am these days less close to the
applications of Urban Economics, and my focus is more on “infrastructure” that
supports the field (as well as a wide range of other areas such as government
policy, or other fields such as geography, planning, or architecture). For
that reason, I’ll probably say very little about the half that focuses on hot
topics, other than I really wish more people in more fields (e.g.,
quantitative geography) did this kind of exercise as a matter of relative
routine).</p>

<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>

<p>This is the bit I’m less close to. I never wrote a model in my PhD, and
there’s a good chance sadly (or not) I never will at this point. But I did
find interesting Duranton’s point about a much more iterative approach to
empirical research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m pushing typical approaches to the extreme to
show neither data nor model should dominate […] Ideally,
use an initial model to guide the empirics
and revise it as progress is made in the data
exploration, etc</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>This to me is the biggie in the slide deck (and in the last couple of decades
of Social Science for that matter…). As Duranton puts it, <em>“we keep winning
the lottery data”</em>. Some sources he flags as game-changer in the last few
years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>-Remote-sensing</li>
  <li>-GPS pings from cellphones</li>
  <li>-(Scrapped) web data</li>
  <li>-Firm/corporate/marketing (what <a href="https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/">some</a> would call consumer) data</li>
  <li>-Historical maps</li>
  <li>-Administrative data becoming spatially referenced</li>
</ul>

<p>Duranton ackowledges he may be forgetting some sources. To be honest, I spend
most of my days thinking <em>just</em> about data and I can’t come up with much more,
other that possibly synthetic data simulated or modelled from disparate
observed sources…</p>

<p>The other point made in this section relates to the challenges these new
sources bring. Not in those words, but his point is these data represent not
only a <em>lot</em> more data, but also <em>different</em> kind of data that require
<em>different</em> kinds of approaches. And we in the social sciences are being slow
to wake up to this realisation (I think).</p>

<p>An important call to not fall prey of the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/11/better-light/">lost keys joke</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Novel data is not a substitute for an
important and well-posed research question,
insightful modeling, and a good research design</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>In Duranton’s view, <em>urban economic research is about</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>i. Acquiring/obtaining data from a four-dimensional world (inc. time)</em></li>
  <li><em>ii. Projecting/processing them onto a dataset with rows and columns of with numbers</em></li>
  <li><em>iii. Estimating quantities of interest out of this table/dataset</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Of the three, he notes <em>ii.</em> has received notably less attention. I agree with
this. Much of the challenge of “democratising” new forms of (unstructured)
data in the social sciences is really about finding ways to turn them intro
(structured) tables they can then work with. Until then, we can hope folks
will become ML wizards but my hunch is the majority won’t. Hence the need to
work in teams (also noted in the slides), not only of urban economists.</p>

<p>The second strand of thought in this section is about methods that <em>generate</em>
data, think predictions from ML models. His view on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Machine-learning approaches have made their
splashy entrance into our toolkit both to create
data (here) and extract patterns out of them.
We need to learn to use appropriate approaches
and use them appropriately</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bit that is not mentioned explicitly (although hinted at through
<em>“textual analysis</em>”</p>

<p>Finally, a point about delineation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Much extent research uses the spatial units it uses
“just because”. This leads to a variety of problems
(measurement error, MAUP, etc). The cost of
delineating appropriate units for a given research
project is no longer prohibitive and will increasingly
become a requirement</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s really refreshing to see this view through beyond methodological
geography (where it’s been most of its raison d’etre for a long time) and
taken so on board. It is one I obviously share, I think we’re at the dawn of a
time where thinking about which spatial unit one should use will be a core
step in every empirical project, and empirical (spatial) research will be
notably better because of that.</p>

<h2 id="ps">Ps.</h2>

<p>As I said at the beginning, above are the bits I find most interesting from
the slides, but this does not mean they’re the more important ones, so do
check out the slides yourself if you’re curious. They are chock full of
recent references, which is another aspect I think we do not do enough of in
talks (we do of course in papers, but there the focus is usually much more
delimitted and less wide ranging than in this case).</p>

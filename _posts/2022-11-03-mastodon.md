I've just officially opened a [working account](https://mapstodon.space/@darribas) on Mastodon. Over the past weeks, buzz has been building on my Twitter feed and, now that the Musk takeover is real, a lot of folks are feeling the pressure to look for alternatives. I was originally skeptic this would have enough traction as there is a very strong network effect hump to get over from "the bird" into anything else, but I've changed my mind in the last couple of days. I am still not sure it'll really work, but now I think it is at least worth trying. On this post, I wanted to put down some of my thoughts on why I *hope* Mastodon becomes a real alternative to Twitter, as well as why I actually *think* we might pull it off. Of course, thoughts and reactions most welcome, for now, both on Twitter ([`darribas`](https://twitter.com/darribas)) *and* Mastodon ([`@darribas@mapstodon.space`](https://mapstodon.space/@darribas)) :-)

- Moved to Mastodon (enough buzz)
- Had been aware for a while but... network effects
- A moment of change now?

- Why I hope that's the case
- - Decentralised
- - Innovation is not that big of a deal (micro-blogging as I use it at least has been stable for a while)
- - This is the worst Mastodon you will know

- Why I think we might pull it off
- - Needs aren't huge
- - Cost also isn't huge at this point
- - People do seem to be on board

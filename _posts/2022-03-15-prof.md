Last month I was promoted to Professor at Liverpool. To say I'm
humbled is a bit of an understatement... It's still a blur and suspect
it'll take a while to sink in. So, while that percolates, here's
a thought crystal clear in my mind: they call it "chair", but professor
really should be "bench".
If the "chair" is partly reward for the achievements of a career, it
really would be best represented as a bench that can accommodate all
the folks who've make it possible. And there're always many of them!
Part of it is the proverbial "giant shoulder-standing", but there is
also the more down-to-earth mentorship, collaboration, peer-support,
and general "ass saving" academic networks provide when everything
else falls.

In my case, I cannot think of a single achievement I'm truly proud of
for which I'm solely responsible. It is impossible to understand my
career without the context in which it's happened, and that has always
been one or another community or colective. So, while I truly am
chuffed about the sound of "prof Dani", let's not forget
how these successes are really made and the mechanisms and social
infrastructure that makes them possible. And let's nurture them
accordingly.

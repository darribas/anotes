With a "best-of-the-year-list spirit" on, and similar to [last year](https://twitter.com/darribas/status/1340979325269667842), these past twelve months I have been able to maintain a bit more sanity and fill in the travelling gap with books. Here's my Top-3 (with a bonus for good measure), in no particular order as they're all equally different and amazing.

"The Ministry for the Future", by Kim Stanley Robinson, is a space to think about life on earth in the next century more than anything else. [This](https://twitter.com/darribas/status/1380477463449468929) is what I said about it in April and, also related, [here're my thoughts](https://darribas.org/anotes/articles/21/ipcc) from august about the IPCC recent report.


Blockchain Chicken Farm, by Xiaowei Wang, is a fascinating collection of short stories about how technology and the XXIst Century intersect with rural China. Insightful, respectful, and fun.

My favorite urban(-related) read of the year was Sarah Williams's Data Action. Again, [this](https://twitter.com/darribas/status/1369573142423863301) is what I said back in March, and it's still fresh as freshly ground coffee beans.

And Honorary mention (because I'm _still_ reading, but already *know* it's part of the List) goes to the 2nd Ed of Francois Chollet's [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). Intuitive, big-picture, and *also* practical. I wish every bit of data science had a book like this!

If you're still reading and want to lurk more, [here's my list from 2020](https://twitter.com/darribas/status/1340979325269667842).
I'm always on the hunt for good books on computers, cities, and data (or anything else worth reading!) so, if you have good recommendations, feel free to send them my way!

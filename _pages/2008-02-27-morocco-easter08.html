<div>My very good friend from Sweden (she's actually spanish but I got to know her in Sweden) Clara is living in Rabat (Morocco) since last October till summer. She´s working for the Embassy in some projects on gender stuff. I felt I couldn´t waste this opportunity to explore the country and pay a visit to her, so we arranged a visit with Chemi (another friend from Sweden) and a couple of guys more for next Easter. As usual, I´ll fly by myself and we´ll all meet there (flight ticket prices made me take the decission... as usual, I was late buying them) and I´ll be in the country from March 14th. to 25th.</div>
<div>In order to keep track of the arrangements and the trip itself (not really once we are there, since the internet availability is expected not to exist), I´ve set up yet one more blog. One may visit <a href="http://marruecos08.blogspot.com">here</a>, but it´s intended to be only for the arrangements, not for pictures and so on, so it might not be that interesting. Pictures and follows-up from the trip will show up here in this blog rather than there...</div>

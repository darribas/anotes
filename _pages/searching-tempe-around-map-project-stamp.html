<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Searching Tempe Around Map-Project (S.T.A.M.P.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a personal project which tries to collect coffee houses, bars, restaurants and every kind of business with a little bit more charm than any commercial chain spread everywhere. I'll be happy if I get to know this is helping other people feeling living in a more human space as well and, of course, I'll be glad to add all the suggestions you do so feel free to drop a comment I'll greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much in advance.</p>
